                    <p class ="intro" >The African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is a smaller and more elusive species of elephant found in the rainforests of central and West Africa.
                         It was once considered a subspecies of the African elephant but was recognized as a distinct species in the 1990s due to differences in genetics, size, and behavior.<br><br>Hover Me!</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Physical Characteristics: Smaller than the African savanna elephant, with straighter tusks and rounder ears.</li>
                        <li>Habitat: Dense rainforests of central and West Africa.</li>
                        <li>Behavior and Diet: Solitary or in small groups; feeds on fruits, leaves, bark, and other vegetation.</li>
                        <li>Conservation Status: Critically Endangered, with fewer than 50,000 individuals remaining; threatened by habitat destruction, poaching for ivory, and human-wildlife conflict.</li>
                        <li>Conservation Efforts: Habitat protection, anti-poaching laws, and efforts to prevent illegal ivory trade.</li>
